- Intro to ML HW1
- This homework will learn the basic guideline of how to use 
  ML toolkit (SK-learn) in Python. (From class distribution, 
  splitting dataset, feature scaling, dataset training and
  testing) In implementation, we will learn what factors 
  would take effect on the performance of the model: 
  
  1. the randomness of splitting training data & testing data 
  2. the portion of training data & testing data

    """
    - In order to prevent a ML model from seeing answers before making 
    predictions, data is usually divived into a training set and a testing 
    set. A training set will be used to train an ML model (e.g. a classifier or 
    a regressor) and a testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of 
    an ML model.
    - Please split the data (both x and y) into a training set and a testing 
    set according to the 'testset_portion'. That is, the testing set will 
    account for 'testset_portion' of the overall data. You may use the function
    'sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split'.

    - By observing the features 'x' in the 'Variable explorer', you will find
    that the values of some feature dimensions are 1, 2, or 1x, while some are 
    1xxx. It shows the values of each feature dimension are at different 
    levels. If these features are directly fed to an ML model, the result will 
    be dominate by the feature dimension with large values. As a result, the 
    process of feature scaling is necessary, which will standardize each 
    feature dimension with mean being 0 and stardard deviation being 1.
    - Please standardize both training set and testing set. You may use the 
    function 'sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler'.
